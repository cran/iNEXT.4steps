Description: Expands 'iNEXT' to include the estimation of sample completeness and evenness. The package provides simple functions to perform the following four-step biodiversity analysis:
       STEP 1: Assessment of sample completeness profiles.
       STEP 2a: Analysis of size-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves to 
       determine whether the asymptotic diversity can be accurately estimated. 
       STEP 2b: Comparison of the observed and the estimated asymptotic diversity profiles. 
       STEP 3: Analysis of non-asymptotic coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves.
       STEP 4: Assessment of evenness profiles. 
       The analyses in STEPs 2a, 2b and STEP 3 are mainly based on the previous 'iNEXT' package. Refer to the 'iNEXT' package for details. This package is mainly focusing on the computation for STEPs 1 and 4. See Chao et al. (2020) <doi:10.1111/1440-1703.12102> for statistical background.
